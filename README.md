Examples and other information about policies

Policies are the core of the Forescout NAC configuration, telling the NAC what to do.  They are built upon the infrastructure, which consists setting up the network, and the means for discovering and controlling devices on the network.  Once the infrastructure in place, we can start implementing the policies.
